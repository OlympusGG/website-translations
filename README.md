## Rules

+ All non-translated keys (keys with `null` as value) will fallback to EN.
+ No key should be added.
+ Only **values** of keys must be modified.
+ A reference key file is provided (keys.yaml)
+ Be careful about values with **curly-braces**: they represent variables **and THEY MUST NOT BE MODIFIED NOR TRANSLATED**.

### **NEVER USE AN EMPTY VALUE WHEN TRANSLATING A KEY IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRANSLATE IT FOR SOME REASON, USE `null` INSTEAD**.

Don't hesitate to fix missing values!

Thanks in advance, \
Olympus Team.
